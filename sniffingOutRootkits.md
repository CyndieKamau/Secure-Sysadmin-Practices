# Checking Hidden Processes in Linux using Unhide Tool.

Linux is a secure Operating System with little malware, but users can get compromised through Rootkit attacks.

Rootkit malware is a collection of software designed to give malicious actors control of a computer network or application. 

Once activated, the malicious program sets up a backdoor exploit and may deliver additional malware, such as ransomware, bots, keyloggers or trojans. 

Rootkit malware can run undetected for a very long period of time.

## Types of Rootkit malware:

* Firmware Rootkits
* Kernel Mode Rootkits
* Bootloader Rootkits
* Virtualized rootkits
* User Mode Rootkits
* Memory Rootkits

As a Linux System Admin it is crucial to constantly check for any hidden processes running in the network, to confirm there are no malicious backdoor processes running undetected.

One can use the **Unhide** tool for analysis.
